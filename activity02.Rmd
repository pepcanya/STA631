# Load your dataset (replace 'file.csv' with your file's name)

**Description of Data**:
+ The dataset contains scores and hours as variables.
+ This dataset is interesting as we want to explore the relationship between hours studied and scores obtained.
+ The dataset was obtained from an educational institution's records.
+ The dataset was created by the educational institution.


```{r}

# Plot each variable separately using histograms
ggplot(scores, aes(x = Hours)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Hours Studied")

ggplot(scores, aes(x = Scores)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "green", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Scores Obtained")

# Plot variables together using a scatter plot
ggplot(scores, aes(x = Hours, y = Scores)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Scores vs. Hours Studied")

# Run the plot_ss function to visualize sum of squared residuals
plot_ss(x = Hours, y = Scores, data = scores)

# Answer the questions based on the visualizations
# 5. Smallest sum of squares and relationship with data points.


# 6. Largest sum of squares and relationship with data points.
