## Day 1

The [meme](https://bouncymustard.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8-funny-work-memes.jpg) that I decided to use for the activity is a \*Pie Chart.\*


The **meme** is a pie chart that has the following title: *Am I ready for Monday?* The only option is No, and all the pie chart is in pink. 

There are some reasons why **Mondays** are though:

+ Transition from Weekend to Work
+ Lack of Motivation
+ Sleep and routine disruption
+ Heavy Workload
+ Mental Adjustment

However, not everything is bad about Mondays, and we should try to find the positive way in everything. As *Dalai Lama* said once: 

> Every day, think as you wake up: Today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it.

Here are some tips to approach each Monday with motivation: 

1. Plan and prioritize the tasks that you are planning on doing 
2. Set a positive tone
3. Find meaning and purpose

After completing this activity, I felt more confident while creating R documents and being able to mold it the way I want it.
